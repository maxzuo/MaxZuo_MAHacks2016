# TweetSafe
A twitter client app which censors sensitive material, like negative, offensive messages.

This uses polarity analysis or sentiment analysis to get the meaning or feeling behind a tweet. It can tell if it is negative news or positive news, and it helps to prevent negative messages from being sent in the first place as well.
